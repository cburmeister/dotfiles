HELP="Usage: $PROG [OPTION]... [CHANNEL]
Play a stream from Digitally Imported <http://www.di.fm/>
or SKY.fm <http://www.sky.fm/> Internet radio.
For high-quality streams, premium subscription is required.

  -b BITRATE        Set the bitrate as kbit/s for the premium subscription.
                    256 is MP3. 128, 64, and 40 are AAC. The default is 256.
                    If the premium ID is not set, this option is ignored and
                    the free stream is played.
  -i PREMIUM        Set the premium ID (a hexadecimal string) needed
                    to construct URLs for premium streams. You can
                    find this string by looking at the URLs of the
                    channels when logged in DI.fm or SKY.fm website.
  -p PLAYER         Set the command to use as the audio player. It has to
                    accept an URL to the playlist (.pls) as the last
                    argument. Wordsplitting is applied to PLAYER, which makes
                    it possible to pass additional command line options to
                    the player program. The default is \`mplayer -playlist'.
  -m                Display a menu using \`dialog' to select the channel
                    and bitrate. The default selections can be specified in
                    the config file or on the command line.
  -n                Don't display a menu even if config file has MENU=yes
                    or the -m option was already used.
  -l                Display the list of available channels. (May be outdated.)
  -u                Download a new channel list to ~/.difmplay_channels.
                    This may not work if the web site formatting has changed.
  -h                Display this help message.

CHANNEL may be an abbreviated name of the channel. The abbreviation has to be
unique except when setting the default selection for the menu.

Default settings can be set in ~/.difmplayrc. It is read as an \`sh' script.
Supported configuration variable names are BITRATE, PREMIUM, PLAYER, MENU
(valid values being \`yes' and \`no'), CHANNEL, MY_CHANNELS, and MY_URLS.

Custom channels can be defined in ~/.difmplayrc: MY_CHANNELS should contain
a white space separated list of channel names that don't conflict with
predefined channel names. MY_URLS should contain a list of playlist URLs.
